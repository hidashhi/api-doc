# The HidashHi API Documentation

## Introduction

The API can be used to build applications, tools or services around the HidashHi resources. It helps developers mitigate the user's interaction with the online environment. You can enable API access in your HidashHi developer account.  

To get started check out our Getting started example application:
 - [Getting started example](examples/getting-started-example/)
  
The HidashHi API consists of a Javascript and a RESTful API.

- [REST API](rest.md)
- [Javascript API ($hi)](js.md)

Other sections:  

- [Guesttoken example](examples/guest_token_guide.md)
- [Older Examples & Tutorials](https://github.com/hidashhi/api-examples)

Enclosed in this repository you will find the official HidashHi API documentation and a getting started example.

**Warning:** the HidashHi API is in **beta testing phase**. The documentation does not reflect the final behavior of the API as it may be subject to change.

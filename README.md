# The HidashHi API Documentation #

## Introduction ##

The API can be used to build applications, tools or services around the HidashHi resources. It helps developers mitigate the user's interaction with the online environment. You can enable API access in your HidashHi developer account.

Enclosed in this repository you will find the official HidashHi API documentation. Feel free to fork and contribute to any topic.

**Warning**, the HidashHi API is in **beta testing phase**. The documentation does not reflect the actual nor the final behavior of the API and both may be subject to change.

# The HidashHi API Documentation

## Introduction

The API can be used to build applications, tools or services around the HidashHi resources. It helps developers mitigate the user's interaction with the online environment. You can enable API access in your HidashHi developer account.  
  
The HidashHi API consists of a Javascript and a RESTful API. (A proprietary TCP/IP protocol will follow.)

- [REST API](api/rest/README.md)
- [Javascript API ($hi)](api/js/README.md)

Other sections:  

- [FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md)
- [Examples & Tutorials](samples_and_how_tos.md)

Enclosed in this repository you will find the official HidashHi API documentation. Feel free to [fork on github](https://github.com/hidashhi/api-doc) and contribute to any topic.

**Warning:** the HidashHi API is in **beta testing phase**. The documentation does not reflect the final behavior of the API as it may be subject to change.
